That means the research focuses on verifiable observation as opposed to theory or logic. Most often this type of research is expressed in numbers. A researcher will represent and manipulate certain observations that they are studying. They will attempt to explain what it is they are seeing and what affect it has on the subject. They will also determine and what the changes may reflect. The overall goal is to convey numerically what is being seen in the research and to arrive at specific and observable conclusions. </p>
